#### highlighted source code for LaTeX

`minted` is a [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) package that uses the [Pygments library](http://pygments.org/) to highlight syntax.

`minted` was created by [Konrad Rudolph](https://github.com/klmr) and is now maintained by [Geoffrey Poore](https://github.com/gpoore) on [github](https://github.com/gpoore/minted).

This fork of `minted` v1.7 is to test features of a [Pygments fork](https://bitbucket.org/jambonrose/pygments-main/), documented [here](https://bitbucket.org/jambonrose/pygments-main/wiki/).

This `minted` fork specifically tests:

- bold lines (`b_lines`)
- strike (out) lines (`so_lines`)
- highlight lines (`hl_lines`)
- diff style output (`difflines`)

Unless you are intent on using features in the Pygments fork above, using the [official `minted` distribution](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/minted) is advisable.

Similarly, only issues pertaining to the options above should be raised here. Any other issues should be raised on the [official `minted` repository](https://github.com/gpoore/minted).
